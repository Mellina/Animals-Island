ENDLESS BATTLE MARCH (FREE): SETUP GUIDE

Dear Unity Developer,
Thank you for downloading this package and supporting my work!

Here are some indications as to how to use this pack.

********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
GENERAL REMARKS:

- DO NOT, under any circumstance, change the folder structure of the "Resources" folder.  The resources folder HAS to be located in your asset folder and the folder structure HAS to remain untouched.
  The reason is that many scrips rely on this folder structure to load the samples into arrays. Many scripts could stop working if you change the folder structure.

- Be sure to add an audio listener to your camera or the game object you attach the script on.  Apparently, this helps with the overall performance of the script.

*********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

How to set it up:
-------------------------------------------------

Go into the "Prefabs" folder and drag and drop the Prefab into your scene.
Adjust the position of the main Prefab, then adjust the position, scale and rotation of the various triggers inside the Prefab.
Duplicate them as necessary in your scene. Once you are done positioning them, simply disable their mesh renderer.  They will be 
invisible but will still trigger the music in your game.

The color codes of the Prefabs are the following:
- Yellow : soft intensity
- Light Orange: medium intensity
- Orange: forte intensity
- Red: stop the music

You are advised to stop the music before changing the tempo.  The soundtracks will sound more natural that way.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER:

- The "Battle_march_demo" scene allows you to test the script to simulate activating or deactivating the different booleans.

I hope you'll be able to make use of this!
